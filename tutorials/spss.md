## Use SPSS Modeler to predict demand for retail

As mentioned in our previous article, our goal is to build an intelligent inventory and distribution strategy using AI. In this part of the 
solution, we will work on predicting future demand of our products to help us determine our optimal inventory level. Currently, our 
procurement manager has asked the development team to create a model to optimize inventory and minimize total landed cost. The first 
part of this solution is to quickly create a model using SPSS Modeler, something that Michelle, our data analyst is very familiar with.
First, let's take a look at the data set we are using to predict demand.
