# Use Decision Optimization to minimize the cost of distribution 
 This hands-on lab is created around the persona of a store manager. The manager has information about the demand, and wants to ensure that inventory is optimized by minimizing the cost of distribution. There are many distribution plants to pick from, each with their own capacity and their own cost. Our goal is to minimize the total cost, while still ensuring we meet all of the demand.

In the previous tutorial we used SPSS Modeler to build a model to predict demand. As you can see below, we will use the demand as input, 
and other information about the distribution plants such as production cost and capacity, to reach
our goal of minimizing overall cost.

### How should I use Decision Optimization to reach an optimal solution?

As shown below, there are 5 main steps in order to reach an optimal decision. As users of Decision Optimization, we are only concerned with step 1 and step 2. We want to formulate the business problem, as 
an optimization problem. That means we have to create data tables to represent our business problem.

## What is an Optimization Problem?

An Optimization problem is the problem of finding the best solution from all possible solutions. We 
do this by defining objectives, constraints, and decision variables.

## What is an Optimization Model?

We have to create an optimization model in order to ensure that our CPLEX Optimization engine
knows how to solve the correct problem. Let's take a look at the optimization model in more detail.

An optimization model defined in terms of
 - an objective, decision variables, and constraints
 - a optimization engine to solve the model instance
 - data to create an instance of the model

### What is an Objective?

An objective is what we are trying to solve for. An example of this is maximizing (profit) or minimizing cost, as is the case in our example here.

### What is a Constraint?

A constraint is a condition that the problem must meet in order to reach an optimal solution. For our
example, we are limited by the capacity of our distribution plants. The capacity (or the maximum number of units that a plant can produce) is our constraint in this example.

### What is a Decision Variable?
A decision variable is a quantity that the decision-maker controls. In our case, the decision-maker is 
the CPLEX Optimization engine, and the quantity that it controls is the quantity of each product to 
be produced at a particular plant.

Now that you understand the main parts of the optimization process, let's take a look at how optimization 
techniques can bring you value.

### Optimization Use Cases

Some of the main use cases for optimization are portfolio allocation based on risk-reward, allocation of 
human resources, and determining which plant should manufacture which product, which is the focus of this tutorial.

* Next, import files into model builder by selecting the files. Click `Import`.
![importProj](../images/Tutorial3-Step2-importdataforopti.png)

### 3. Run model and analyze results
* Click on `Run model` on model builder and you will see 3 options to build optimization model. For this example we use the modeling assistant, Click `Use Modeling Assistant`

![runProj](../images/Tutorial3-Step3-runmodel.png)

There are different decision domains currently available in the Modeling Assistant and you can be guided to choose the right domain for your problem. Documentation on different domains can be found [here](https://www.ibm.com/support/producthub/icpdata/docs/content/SSQNUZ_current/do/DODS_Mdl_Assist/mdl_asst_domains.html)

For this problem we will be using Selection and Allocation domain. Selection problems are about choosing from a list of possibilities. You can use the Selection and Allocation domain when you have combined all the possible choices. We would like to select the products(which are resources) for this model that we can allocate to counties.

**Selection & Allocation domain**

* Click `Selection & Allocation` domain and it asks series of questions. It needs to understand which table to select the data. The first question asked is `What are the items (or combinations) to select from?` Click on `Choose a table` drop down menu and select `CountyDemand` table. The next question is around allocation. The modeling assistant needs to understand if this is just a selection problem or it is combination of selection and allocation. The question asked is `How do you want the selection to be made ?` Turn the toggle on to allocate quantities and Click `Continue`. This will now frame the modeling problem automatically. You will see a screen that shows `Select and allocate CountyDemands.` Click `Finish`
![runProj](../images/Tutorial3-Step3-ModelingAssistant.gif)

* **Define Objectives** - In this step we would like to define our Objectives.

  **Objective 1**

      The first thing we would like is to allocate as much product that we can to the counties. In the suggestion section one can freely write the objective in English as an natural language. We will type in `Maximize total CountyDemand allocations` and hit enter. This will then show the list of all possible suggestions related to the CountyDemand table. Click the `+` icon next to the suggested objective. You will see that the objective is moved to the left-hand side under Objectives

  **Objective 2**

    The second objective is to make the allocation fair with respect to demand. In the suggestion box type `Balance gap between allocation  and demand over CountyDemands` look at all the suggestions and pick the one that has the objective.

  **Remove Objective**

    On the left-hand side when we formulated the objective the modeling assistant had already assumed an objective called `Maximize the total CountyDemand selections`. We don't need that so we can click the three dots next to it and it shows the options. Click `Remove`

![runProj](../images/Tutorial3-Step3-addObjectiveFunction.gif)

* **Define constraints**

  There are 3 constraints that we need to add

  **Constraint 1**  
    Since the quantities are in integers we want to make sure that the selection and allocation must be integers. To do so we will type `All CountyDemand allocations  must be integer` in suggestions section. Click the `+` icon to add to the models

  **Constraint 2**  
    Allocation of quantities need to be less the requested demand by counties. To do so we will type `For each CountyDemand , allocation  is less than or equal to  demand` in suggestions section. Click the `+` icon to add to the models

  **Constraint 3**  
    Overall budget for entire state is limited and allocation needs to be below allocated budget(in total units). To do so we will type `total CountyDemand allocations  is less than or equal to  max_budget of AllocationParameters ` in suggestions section. Click the `+` icon to add to the models

![runProj](../images/Tutorial3-Step3-Constraints.gif)

### 4. Explore other options

  **The Suggestions filter**
    You can also filter the suggestions to find objectives and constraints. Set Display by category to on (a tick is displayed on the switch) which opens a pane for you to select various categories of interest and apply filters to the list of suggestions. The filters enable you to see fewer suggestions.

  **The Settings tab**
    The Settings tab in the model view lists different scheduling and optimization parameters that can be edited. In this example the default duration unit, the optimization run time and the date/time format are shown. You can specify here a customized date/time format to suit your data.
  **The Data Schema tab**

    The Data Schema tab view lists, table by table, all information that the Modeling Assistant has imported and deduced from the input data that is necessary for the scheduling problem to be solved. This can be useful for expert users for data debugging purposes.

![runProj](../images/Tutorial3-Step4-Otheroptions.gif)

### 5. Run the model
You can change the solve time limit for your model in the model view in the Settings tab on the right. For this example, use the default limit. Other parameters can also be set using run configuration parameters (see [Run parameters](https://www.ibm.com/support/producthub/icpdata/docs/content/SSQNUZ_current/do/DODS_RunParameters/runparams.html#RunConfig) for more information).

Click `Run model` on the top. Combined Objective is displayed in this run status pop-up window. If you want to end this run before the optimal solution is obtained, you can quit by clicking Stop

![runProj](../images/Tutorial3-Step5-Run-model.png)

### 6. Explore solution

* When the run is completed, you can see the results in the `Explore solution` view. You can also click LOG to inspect the solver engine log files. The first table in the Explore solution view shows the objective (or objectives if you have several) with its values and the subsequent tables provides product selection and allocation.You can also download the solution tables as csv files.

![runmodel](../images/Tutorial3-Step6-explore-solution.png)

### 7. Create a new scenario different model same data

* Although you have solved the model in reality we need the units based on importance of products needed. For example ventilators and masks have a high importance and is needed first to save lives. We need to readjust the model to reflect the reality and maximize allocation based on importanceFactor

Create a new scenario in the model from scenario 1. Click the Scenario button on top of the page and scenario panel opens on the side. You will see Scenario 1 on it you will notice three dots, Click on it to see the drop down menu. Click the `Duplicate` and you will be prompted to give a name of new scenario. Type `Baseline with Importance` Click `Create`

![newscenario](../images/Tutorial3-Step7-duplicate-scenario.png)
![newscenario](../images/Tutorial3-Step7-duplicate-scenario-name.png)


* Click Run Model on left-hand side and it will show the modeling assistant model. In the suggestions type `Maximize total importanceFactor of product of allocation`. You will see the `Maximize total importanceFactor of product of CountyDemands over all allocations` objective in the suggestion. Click the `+` icon to add the objective to the model. You can use the slider to give this objective  more importance.

![newscenario](../images/Tutorial3-Step7-importance-objective.png)
![newscenario](../images/Tutorial3-Step7-importance-objective-slider.png)

Click `Run Model` and look at the solution in `Explore Solution` on left-hand-side

Click the Scenario button on top of the page and scenario panel opens on the side. You will see Scenario 1 on it you will notice three dots, Click on it to see the drop down menu. Click the `Rename` and you will be prompted to give a name of new scenario. Type `Baseline`


### 8. Visualization within model builder

* Click `Visualization` to build a dashboard.Click pencil icon to open visualization editor. Click `Json` and delete the content.
![visualization](../images/Tutorial3-Step8-visualization.png)

You should see the following Dashboard
![visualization](../images/Tutorial3-Step8-visualization-dashboard.png)

### 9. Generating a Python notebook from your scenario

* If you want to generate a Python notebook from your model created with the Modeling Assistant:
  * If the scenario panel is not open, click the `Scenarios` icon.
  * Click the three dots next to one of your scenarios and select `Generate` notebook.
  * Enter a name for your notebook and click Generate.
  * A Python notebook for this model is created in your Project.

### Summary


Optimization-based decision applications involve embedded optimization models and algorithms as part of larger applications that may include
integration with databases and other enterprise systems. These applications can be used to perform A-B testing, where users can compare different scenarios, each involving different data.

By invoking the optimization model interactively and repeatedly, users can judge the impact of data changes, and analyze trade-offs between conflicting business goals and constraints.

This tutorial demonstrates a small example of creating a prescriptive optimization model on IBM Decision Optimization on Watson Studio(CPLEX engine). The tutorial goes over on importing the scenario into the project and running the model. The last step of the tutorial is about how to visualize and evaluate the results. -->
