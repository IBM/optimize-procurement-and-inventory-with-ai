# Create a web-application to prescribe an optimal procurement strategy

<!-- ![finalDemo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10428517/82013347-f7e71500-962e-11ea-9c28-2dec7d5b30cd.gif) -->

As shown above, this application leverages Decision Optimization machine learning models to tell the user which plant to order items for in order to minimize cost.

By leveraging AI and machine learning, we help a store manager predict demand and optimize inventory while choosing plants with the lowest cost.

## Description

<!-- Using IBM AutoAI, you automate all the tasks involved in building predictive models for different requirements. You see how AutoAI generates great models quickly which save time and effort and aid in faster decision-making process. You create a model that from a data set that includes the age, sex, BMI, number-of-children, smoking preferences, region and charges to predict the health insurance premium cost that an individual pays. -->

When you have completed this code pattern, you understand how to:

<!-- * Setup, quickly, the services on IBM Cloud for building the model.
* Ingest the data and initiate the AutoAI process.
* Build different models using AutoAI and evaluate the performance.
* Choose the best model and complete the deployment.
* Generate predictions using the deployed model by making REST calls.
* Compare the process of using AutoAI and building the model manually.
* Visualize the deployed model using a front-end application. -->

## Flow Description
1. The user creates an IBM Watson Studio Service on IBM Cloud.
2. The user creates an IBM Cloud Object Storage Service and adds that to Watson Studio.
<!-- 3. The user uploads the insurance premium data file into Watson Studio.
4. The user creates an AutoAI Experiment to predict insurance premium on Watson Studio
5. AutoAI uses Watson Machine Learning to create several models, and the user deploys the best performing model.
6. The user uses the Flask web-application to connect to the deployed model and predict an insurance charge. -->
